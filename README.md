## About The Project

This is a rhythm game in which you have to click on the falling tiles.

A brief list of features:
* Record your gameplay
* Import maps from osu (another popular rhythm game)

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
